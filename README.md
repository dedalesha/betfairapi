BetFair API Playground

The purpose is to investigate Betfair API and to place some bets according to some rules.

The plan so far is to:

 - Use Jersey to access RESTful Betfair endpoint
 - Use drools for betting rules  

- [X] F1: Can log-in
- [ ] F2: Can list markets
- [ ] F3: Choose and integrate a logging API: log4j 2 or logback
- [ ] F4: Introduce Java entities
- [ ] F5: Introduce dependency injection: Spring or Guice
- [X] F6: Autogenerate enumerations
- [X] F7: Autogenerate data types 
- [ ] F8: Autogenerate interfaces
- [ ] F9: Proxy the interfaces with Rest call implementation
- [ ] R1: Improve handling of java type conversion in XSL templates (convert only once)
